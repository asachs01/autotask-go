This is either LDAP or ADFS..I imagine most if not all will be LDAP,\r\n which is fine.\r\n\r\nWe will need an AD Service Account username and password that has Read Only access into AD. This account is used to view the user details within AD and populate them into\r\n CIM so that the user can authenticate correctly when trying to access CAD, Mobile, or RMS. If a service account already exists that they want to use, thats perfectly fine, it just needs read only access.\r\n\r\nWe will need know which AD security group(s) they want to import users from. This can be multiple groups or a single generic group, but if there are separate agencies (such\r\n as XX police and XX fire), then we will need the PD and Fire users in separate security groups. This is because we technically have to make separate connections to AD to get the users into the correct Fire or PD agency in CIM if they are separate. The same\r\n service account is fine for multiple connections, we would just need separate security groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will also need to adjust some firewall rules so that our CIM (common identity management) servers can hit your domain controllers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSeth Graham\r\n\r\nDirector of Information Technology\r\n\r\nHamilton County 9-1-1\r\n\r\nEmergency Communications District\r\n\r\n423-622-1911\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nTodd Wooten\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications Supervisor\r\n\r\n\r\nTerminal Agency Coordinator\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting Agency Coordinator \r\n\r\n\r\nLookout Mountain Police/Fire Dept/Communications\r\n\r\n\r\n710 Scenic Hwy\r\n\r\n\r\nPO Box 111\r\n\r\n\r\nLookout Mtn,TN 37350\r\n\r\n\r\n(423)821-3151 w\r\n\r\n\r\n(423)693-8753 c\r\n\r\n**Created via Incoming Email Processor**\r\nFrom: Davy Nicholson <dnicholson@lookoutmtn.us>\r\nTo: \"support\" <support@wyretechnology.com>","dueDateTime":"2025-03-28T21:00:00Z","estimatedHours":null,"externalID":"","firstResponseAssignedResourceID":29682895,"firstResponseDateTime":"2025-02-17T14:34:33.987Z","firstResponseDueDateTime":"2025-02-18T21:27:58.047Z","firstResponseInitiatingResourceID":29682895,"hoursToBeScheduled":null,"impersonatorCreatorResourceID":null,"isAssignedToComanaged":false,"issueType":7,"isVisibleToComanaged":true,"lastActivityDate":"2025-03-05T15:45:29.66Z","lastActivityPersonType":1,"lastActivityResourceID":4,"lastCustomerNotificationDateTime":"2025-02-17T14:38:41.437Z","lastCustomerVisibleActivityDateTime":"2025-02-17T14:38:23.03Z","lastTrackedModificationDateTime":"2025-03-05T15:45:19.57Z","monitorID":null,"monitorTypeID":null,"opportunityID":null,"organizationalLevelAssociationID":null,"previousServiceThermometerRating":null,"priority":3,"problemTicketId":null,"projectID":null,"purchaseOrderNumber":"","queueID":29682833,"resolution":"","resolutionPlanDateTime":null,"resolutionPlanDueDateTime":null,"resolvedDateTime":null,"resolvedDueDateTime":null,"rmaStatus":null,"rmaType":null,"rmmAlertID":null,"serviceLevelAgreementHasBeenMet":null,"serviceLevelAgreementID":1,"serviceLevelAgreementPausedNextEventHours":null,"serviceThermometerTemperature":null,"source":4,"status":17,"subIssueType":213,"ticketCategory":3,"ticketNumber":"T20250217.0015","ticketType":1,"title":"Fwd: FW: CAD -> Active Directory   Need some help with this","userDefinedFields":[]},{"id":29763,"apiVendorID":null,"assignedResourceID":29682928,"assignedResourceRoleID":29683355,"billingCodeID":29682801,"changeApprovalBoard":null,"changeApprovalStatus":null,"changeApprovalType":null,"changeInfoField1":"","changeInfoField2":"","changeInfoField3":"","changeInfoField4":"","changeInfoField5":"","companyID":199,"companyLocationID":27,"completedByResourceID":null,"completedDate":null,"configurationItemID":null,"contactID":null,"contractID":29683376,"contractServiceBundleID":null,"contractServiceID":null,"createDate":"2025-02-17T21:59:01.567Z","createdByContactID":null,"creatorResourceID":29682895,"creatorType":1,"currentServiceThermometerRating":null,"description":"Problem: TAG FS19DC-TM took 7 minutes and 6 seconds to process a single user password reset.
